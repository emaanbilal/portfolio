			<h2>Subtheme: Exploring Corporate Owners and Evictions</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How has the prevalence of corporate ownership evolved across Boston neighborhoods from 2004 to 2024?</li>
                <p> Motivation: The Housing Justice Beyond the Emergency report explicitly identifies "absentee, institutional ownership" as a primary driver of housing instability, finding that a 1% increase in institutional ownership correlates with more than 2% increased eviction filings. Thus, given that ownership structure seems to influence eviction pressure, understanding whether corporate ownership is increasing over time in Boston is an important initial question to examine whether the city's ownership structure is shifting toward conditions that prior work has associated with instability. 
				<li>How has owner-occupancy changed across Boston neighborhoods from 2004 to 2024? Does this trend coincide with that of corporate ownership?                </li>
                <p> Motivation: The same report has also found that live-in landlords had significantly lower eviction filing rates. This suggests that owner-occupancy, as a proxy for local control, may protect against tenant displacement. Exploring this question will both help us identify whether there appears to a structural shift away from historically stable ownership patterns, and whether a replacement dynamic is at play: are we losing live-in landlords specifically because corporations are replacing them? </p>
                <li>Are these changes disproportionately concentrated in communities of color?</li>
                <p> Motivation: Both background readings document strong racial inequities in eviction filings, with 43% of filings occurring in majority-nonwhite neighborhoods despite them housing only 32% of renters. If corporate ownership is found to be increasing more rapidly in neighborhoods with higher shares of Black and Latinx residents, this may indicate that structural changes in ownership are layering onto existing racial inequities in housing instability, uncovering a crucial connection that should be addressed in conversations around housing justice.  
                <li>Do corporate buyers use cash purchases at higher rates than non-corporate buyers, particularly in lower-income or more vulnerable neighborhoods?</li>
                <p> Motivation: The NYT article has described the eviction system as one that prioritizes "efficiency" for landlords over due process for tenants. In the property acquisition market, cash offers are the ultimate tool of efficiency, and it is plausible that corporate buyers leverage this liquidity to "price out" individual residents who rely on mortgages, effectively preventing local residents from becoming homeowners and creating fertile ground for rampant eviction patterns. As such, if corporate actors are found to disproportionately use cash in certain neighborhoods, it may indicate structural barriers to community-based ownership, helping establish downstream structural barriers that determine ownership flow and perpetuate inequitable housing dynamics. </p>
                <li>Is there evidence of ownership consolidation where a small number of buyers control a large share of properties?</li>
                <p> Motivation: "Concentrated ownership” by absentee and institutional landlords has repeatedly been cited as a risk factor for higher eviction filings. Such a monopoly on housing can dictate market prices and eviction policies more aggressively, connecting directly to systemic landlord power discussed implicitly in both readings. </p>

			<h2>Phase 1: Shape, Structure, and Data Quality Overview</h2>
        
            <h3>Initial Data Profiling and Constraints</h3>
            <p>I began by exploring the data to understand its structure, granularity, and overall quality. My initial audit involved checking for missing values, duplicates, and outliers, assessing completeness, identifying anomalies, and verifying that the dataset behaved in logically consistent ways. I found that each neighborhood's data points are distinctly represented across all years and that there were no null values in the primary corporate ownership dataset. I verified that each neighborhood appears consistently across all 21 years, confirming a balanced panel structure. No duplicate neighborhood-year entries were detected, and no null values were present in the primary ownership rate variables. I also verified that the focal metrics, corporate ownership rate and owner-occupancy rate, were consistently recorded and accurately bounded between 0 and 1, as expected for proportion-based measures. Summary statistics indicated that the average corporate ownership rate across the panel is 0.116 (11.6%), with values ranging from 0.0429 to 0.2005 and a median of 0.1219. This confirms meaningful variation across neighborhoods while remaining within plausible limits. </p>
            
            <p>However, a critical review of the available variables revealed that there is no direct eviction filing data present in the datasets. This constraint reaffirmed the value of focusing on the structural ownership patterns associated with eviction risk, rather than eviction outcomes directly. Based on the <em>Homes for All</em> report, absentee and corporate landlords are heavily associated with higher eviction filing rates, whereas local, live-in landlords contribute to housing stability. Given this constraint, my subsequent analysis shifted toward understanding the systemic indicators of these ownership shifts and how they interact with community demographics.</p>

            <p>While examining the population demographic fields across different years, I performed a data quality gut check by visualizing total population over time. I discovered that the total population remained completely constant from 2004 to 2024. Repeating this check for other demographic variables (e.g., black_all, hisp_all, white_all, aapi_all) confirmed that these fields also remain constant across years. This indicates that the demographic data represents a static census snapshot rather than annually updated estimates. This distinction is critical because while ownership trends can be analyzed dynamically over time, demographic composition could thus only be interpreted as contextual background rather than evolving population change. It also helps point to major neighbourhoods useful for future analysis, such as Dorchester and Roxbury with significantly higher population counts.</p>

                Each point represents the recorded total population for a neighborhood in a given year. The consistent shading of points within each neighborhood indicates that total population values remain constant across all years in the dataset.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>To make use of these static snapshots, I transformed the raw data by creating calculated fields in Tableau. I calculated the proportional representation of each racial group per neighborhood (e.g., <code>SUM([black_all]) / SUM([tot_pop_all])</code>). This ensured that comparisons across neighborhoods would not be distorted by differences in absolute population size. Because the <em>Homes for All</em> report highlights that communities of color, especially Black and Latinx renters, faced disproportionately high rates of eviction filings, it was vital to establish the racial geography of Boston. Using these calculated proportions, I created a "Dominant Race" categorical field, defined as the racial group (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, or Other) with the highest population share within a neighborhood, setting a foundation for subsequent spatial analysis. This was essential for later investigating whether ownership shifts are unevenly distributed across communities of color.</p>

			<figure>

				<figcaption>
				Racial Demographics of Boston Neighborhoods (2024). This spatial categorization highlights distinct geographic clustering, such as majority-Black neighborhoods in the center/south (e.g., Roxbury, Dorchester, Mattapan) and majority-Hispanic populations in East Boston. Several western neighborhoods are majority-White.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>Now that racial distribution was established, I assessed the internal consistency of ownership measures. To do this, I examined the trend for the corporate ownership rate and owner-occupancy rate across all neighborhood-year observations. This provided a baseline for understanding whether ownership patterns were stable over time within each neighborhood or whether there were shifts consistent with prior work's findings.</p>

			Plotting the city-wide averages for both the Corporate Ownership Rate and the Owner Occupancy Rate on a dual-axis line chart, there appeared an evident rise of corporate ownership concurrent with eroding local, live-in ownership (albeit at a slower pace). This pattern was consistent with prior work's findings, suggesting that the city's ownership structure is shifting towards a more corporate-dominated model, warranting more granular examination. We can also see that corporate ownership shows a notably high growth rate (seen by the steep gradient) between 2019 to 2021, corresponding to COVID-19's impact, as explored in the NYT article as well. <figure>

				Corporate Ownership Rate and Owner Occupancy Rate Trends (2004–2024). This dual-axis line chart shows the city-wide averages for both the Corporate Ownership Rate and the Owner Occupancy Rate across years. The Corporate Ownership Rate has been consistently increasing, while the Owner Occupancy Rate has been decreasing (although at a slower pace). These trend lines validate the literature’s claim that corporate consolidation is steadily replacing "mom-and-pop" live-in landlords across the city. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>A scatterplot with a fitted linear trendline yielded the following relationship:</p>

			<code>Corp Own Rate = –0.366 × Own Occ Rate + 0.275</code>
			<code>(R² = 0.375, p < 0.0001)</code>
			
			<p>This confirms an expected structural inverse relationship: neighborhoods with higher levels of owner occupancy tend to exhibit lower levels of corporate ownership. This is consistent with the conceptual distinction between locally controlled housing and institutional ownership structures described in prior research.</p>
			
			<p>Importantly, this step was conducted as a structural diagnostic, not as a causal claim since a host of other factors may influence these trends. The goal was to confirm that the dataset behaves coherently with theoretical expectations and that the dataset captures meaningful ownership regimes as expected.</p>

			<p>Transitioning to the Residential sales data, I profiled the distribution of sale prices and property characteristics to ensure data integrity before analyzing market behaviors like cash sales. The residential sales dataset is structured at the transaction level, with each row representing a property sale between 2000 and 2022. Because transaction-level data are more prone to anomalies, I conducted additional quality checks. This revealed notable anomalies: several transactions featured exceptionally high sale prices but were listed as having 0 bedrooms and 0 bathrooms. These records likely represent commercial land sales, non-market transfers, or data entry errors. To ensure they do not skew my subsequent analysis, I filtered out all residential transactions with 0 beds/baths, substantially influencing the price range, as seen in the figure below.</p>

			<h3></h3>Phase I Summary</h3>
			<p>By the end of this exploratory phase, several important structural characteristics were established:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The corporate ownership dataset is complete and balanced across neighborhood–years (2004–2024).</li>
				<li>Demographic variables are static census snapshots across years and must be treated as fixed contextual characteristics.</li>
				<li>Corporate ownership and owner occupancy move in opposite directions across years, consistent with prior expectations.</li>
				<li>Corporate ownership rates vary meaningfully across neighborhoods, ranging from approximately 4% to 20%.</li>
				<li>The residential sales dataset is transaction-level, highly skewed in price, and required targeted cleaning to remove implausible entries.</li>
				<li>No direct eviction data are present; therefore, the analysis should focus on structural ownership dynamics associated with eviction risk in prior research.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This structural understanding established a rigorous foundation for Phase 2, where I turned to investigating how corporate ownership has evolved over time and whether these shifts are unevenly distributed across Boston neighborhoods.</p>
